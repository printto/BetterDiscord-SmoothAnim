# Smooth Anim for BetterDiscord

A simple BetterDiscord theme that adds smooth transitions and subtle animations to Discord.

## Features

- Smooth UI transitions using CSS `transition`
- Minimal use of keyframe animations for visual polish
- Hover animations for server list items
- Fade-in effects for images and popouts

This theme focuses on using `transition` for better performance. Keyframes are used selectively to enhance appearance.

This theme does **not** change Discord’s visual layout or colours, only the animations — making it compatible with most other themes.
