# Smooth Anim for BetterDiscord

An Aero theme that adds smooth transitions and subtle animations to your BetterDiscord.

## Features

- Smooth UI transitions using CSS `transition`
- Minimal use of keyframe animations for visual polish
- Hover animations for server list items
- Fade-in effects for images and popouts

This theme focuses on using `transition` for better performance. Keyframes are used selectively to enhance appearance.

This theme also changes BetterDiscord’s visual layout and colours, you may use only the transitions, animations, and keyframes — making it compatible with other themes.
